This research explores the application of deep learning
techniques for predicting and enhancing network performance across key areas like
traﬃc forecasting, fault detection, and quality of service (QoS) management.


By using deep neural networks such as LSTM, CNN, Transformers, Autoencoders and GANs
the study demonstrates how machine learning can automate network monitoring, reduce
downtime, and improve resource allocation in real-time environments.

Data Inputs:
Time-stamped network performance data including:
1. Signal strength (dBm)
2. Latency (ms)
3. Throughput (Mbps)
4. RF measurements
5. Locality, Network Type
Models Used
